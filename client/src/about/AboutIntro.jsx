          Swatantra Academy functions on the conviction that persistent and widespread social problems have their root cause in public policies that either interfere with or fail to support the operation of individuals, civil society, community, institutions, and free market-based solutions.

          We believe that liberty and prosperity are inseparable from the practice of free enterprise and adherence to the rule of law. We seek to inspire future leaders and change agents to pursue the vision of a free society by championing a liberal approach to public policy. It would include less government regulation, control, privilege, and sectional interests. A liberal society is tolerant of different philosophical and ethical doctrines - allowing individuals to freely form and express their convictions and opinions. Individuals must be free to make decisions about their own lives and engage in meaningful pursuits without threat of violence. Governments must not provide services that can be better delivered by competitive enterprise. To achieve social change, it is crucial to influence the public intellectuals who disseminate ideas to society. Through a proactive approach and sustained engagement, we create spaces for intellectual discourse to take place.
